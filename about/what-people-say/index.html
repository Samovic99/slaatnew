                Dear Zuzanna,<br>

<i>I wanted to send you this email on behalf of Diane's family to say a very big thank you to all members of
Sycamore Lodge staff who looked after Mum during her very short time with you.
The care which you all showed towards Mum was outstanding. We were all so pleased when Mum moved into Sycamore Lodge especially after meeting various staff members, we knew that she would be well looked after and cared for with dignity and respect.
Everyone we came in contact with was always friendly, on the few visits to Mum, in room 28, we were made to feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble even though the staff have such busy and demanding roles.
I am sorry that I do not know the names of everyone we came across, but Mum was in residence from 5th November until she was taken into hospital on 10th November.
I would like to give special thanks to Andrew and to Chris.
Andrew provided myself and Dad with so much reassurance that Mum would be looked after and cared for well, this was good to hear as we, as a family, had never experienced anything like this life-changing situation before.
We had experienced some issues with Mums discharge from the Hospital, Andrew was already aware of, again this gave us confidence and we knew that Mum was in caring and very professional hands. Please pass on our thanks and gratitude to Andrew, and wish him all the very best, he certainly has made the right career choice, but tell him he still needs to book the odd holiday.
Chris was so kind, professional and thoughtful when I personally liaised with him on Mum's return to Sycamore Lodge from hospital on the evening of the 10th November and again during the very early hours of Thursday 11th November.
Chris's reassuring manner and caring words made a very difficult time calmer. We know that Mums final hours will have been peaceful and that she was cared for so very well, we will be forever grateful to Chris and his night team for making Mum as comfortable as possible in her final hours.
Please pass on our grateful thanks to Chris, I personally will never forget his phone call and his gentle kind manner. A thank you to the girls who provided us with tea and biscuits during those early hours, this was very much appreciated.
The Sycamore Lodge team are a great credit to the Marjara Care Group, please pass my comments on to all staff members and our thanks once again to you all.
Kindest Regards to you all</i>

                <i>To all staff, could you please pass on my thanks to the staff at your care home. My mother was not in your care for a long time, but in her eyes this was her home. As you all know my mother had dementia and coupled with the fact she could not talk. Whilst she was within your care, my wife and I understand from my mothers wards that she felt safe and secure in your care. I had a chat in the office because we would have liked my mother to stay at your home after her leg was better. My mother actually called her home in Barton as her old home, and because of the care and love gives her yours was thought of as her new home. Again, thank you for the care and support you gave to my mother and to myself and family.</i>
