										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past 2 years has been one of the most challenging times in the history of our sector. During this period all staff have shown incredible dedication and support to the service. It is estimated that over 1,000 social care staff lost their lives to covid. Others lost their lives for many other reasons, and there was a huge loss of life to Care Home residents.</p>
<p>Organisations across the sector have joined together to create a memorial where people can come together to reflect and remember those that we lost during this time.</p>
<p>A &#8216;Memorial Wall&#8217; and &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page are now available on the Care Workers Charity website. On the site you are able to submit a picture and a message in memory of a friend, colleague or family member who has been lost, which in turn will be featured on the Memorial Wall. In addition to the &#8216;Memorial Wall&#8217; there is a &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page where you can write a message of thanks to the social care workforce.</p>
<p>These can be personal messages for a Care Worker who supported a person&#8217;s relative or someone thanking their colleagues. Visit the Care Workers Charity website or use the link below</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zmvH08KXZT"><p><a href="https://www.thecareworkerscharity.org.uk/covid-19-tribute/">Social Care Day of Remembrance and Reflection</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Social Care Day of Remembrance and Reflection&#8221; &#8212; The Care Workers Charity" src="https://www.thecareworkerscharity.org.uk/covid-19-tribute/embed/#?secret=zmvH08KXZT" data-secret="zmvH08KXZT" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The day will be an opportunity for everyone impacted by the work of the social care sector to reflect on the important work done by Care Workers and pay tribute to the people we lost, the people who supported us, and the people who made it through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The Care Workers Charity is also fundraising to invest in a fitting tribute to the important work of the social care sector.</p>
<p>A Just Giving page has been set up for the Social Care Day of Reflection and Remembrance, just go onto the Just Giving website and search for The Care Workers Charity or visit the link below https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/social-care-day-remembrance-and-reflection If you would like to get more involved, there are fundraising packs available on the Care Workers Charity website and Skills for Care also have information available.</p>
<p>Autograph Care will also be creating their own Memorial and Thank You wall on their website.</p>
<p>If you would like to pay tribute to anyone at the Company, please email your message and/or attach your photograph to karen.ragan@autographcare.co.uk</p>

<p>Speak with those living in a similar situation for advice and guidance, or simply to know you’re not alone and there is a community of people who can offer support for you and your family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let us know you’re coming by phone or email on&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tel: <a href="tel:01924 589 430">01924 589 430</a></strong></p>

<p>After our successful trip to see the Vulcan we decided to take our Veteran gentleman (and everyone else we could fit in two mini buses) to visit the Battle of Britain Museum in Coningsby.</p>
<p>When we arrived the AEWAC was warming up of the runway with all engines – everyone hung of the Mini bus window to get a better look. We saw two Typhoons taking off as well.</p>
<p>Our hero had flown thirty three sorties as a rear gunner in WW2. The staff at Coningsby were amazing. We were given a VIP tour by a fantastic gentleman who told us some wonderful human interest stories about the heroes who flew the planes in WW2. I think everyone shed a tear at some point. Every plane in the Hangar is still airborne.</p>
<p>The Lancaster stood tall and majestic at the end of the Hangar and our own much loved hero stood proudly at the Rear Gunner position for his photo call.</p>
<p>Thank you BBMF for ou r VIP Tour of your amazing establishment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Olive’s Wish &#8211; a disco</h3>
<p>A tall order when all the nightclubs open at midnight!<br />
Fortunately our new pub provides an excellent party space so decided to have our own disco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After discussion with our residents we decided to spice things up a bit and have a Masquerade Disco! We ordered some masks and everyone set about decorating them with our vast collection of sparkly items in the craft room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2665 size-large" title="Dancing at Party" src="https://www.monsonrh.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DSCN0104-blog-1024x768.jpg" alt="Dancing at Party" width="980" height="735" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2667 size-large" title="Residents with masquerade masks" src="https://www.monsonrh.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DSCN0151-blog-1024x768.jpg" alt="Residents with masquerade masks" width="980" height="735" /><br />
Chef sorted the chocolate supply for the fountain and the goodies to dip in (most of them healthy) Elvis, our resident music guru brought his equipment to DJ. And we threw in a Piñata for good measure.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2666 size-large" title="Pinata at Party" src="https://www.monsonrh.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DSCN0125-blog-1024x768.jpg" alt="Pinata at Party" width="980" height="735" /><br />
It is always the old favourites that get everyone up and they certainly did. Lots of dancing, singing and best of all laughter. Obviously, all of the chocolate went and we have many fabulous photos for our album to look back on.</p>
