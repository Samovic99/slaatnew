										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to be announcing a significant milestone in our commitment to environmental sustainability and social responsibility, with all our homes having achieved the Green Mark accreditation.</p>
<p>Our responsibility extends beyond providing exceptional standards of care. We also have a deep-rooted commitment to the well-being of our planet and the communities that we serve.</p>
<p>The Green Mark Certification assesses, audits, and certifies companies based on their impact on the environment.</p>
<p>We are delighted to have been awarded this Green Mark Accreditation as a testament to our continuous efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, conserve resources, and create a more eco-friendly environment across all our homes.</p>
<p>From our Board of Directors to the residents in our care, green thinking matters, and environmental responsibility is taken into account in key decision-making.</p>
<p>From limiting the use of single-use items to implementing recycling processes for both staff and residents, we are making small changes that amount to big results.</p>
<p><strong>What Does Green Mark Accreditation Represent for Autograph Care?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> We have implemented energy-efficient technologies and practices, reducing our energy consumption and lowering our carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Waste Reduction:</strong> Our commitment to sustainability extends to waste reduction. We have adopted recycling programs and implemented responsible waste management practices to minimize our impact on the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Resident Well-being:</strong> We believe that sustainability and well-being go hand in hand. Our efforts to create a greener environment contribute to a healthier and more comfortable living space for our residents.</p>
<p><strong>Future Initiatives:</strong> Achieving Green Mark is just the beginning. We are continuously exploring innovative ways to further reduce our ecological footprint and promote social responsibility.</p>
<p>As we celebrate this milestone, we remain committed to our vision of creating a better environment for our residents and our community.</p>
<p>The Green Mark accreditation is not just an accreditation; it is a symbol of our ongoing dedication to sustainable and responsible practices and something we are incredibly proud of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past 2 years has been one of the most challenging times in the history of our sector. During this period all staff have shown incredible dedication and support to the service. It is estimated that over 1,000 social care staff lost their lives to covid. Others lost their lives for many other reasons, and there was a huge loss of life to Care Home residents.</p>
<p>Organisations across the sector have joined together to create a memorial where people can come together to reflect and remember those that we lost during this time.</p>
<p>A &#8216;Memorial Wall&#8217; and &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page are now available on the Care Workers Charity website. On the site you are able to submit a picture and a message in memory of a friend, colleague or family member who has been lost, which in turn will be featured on the Memorial Wall. In addition to the &#8216;Memorial Wall&#8217; there is a &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page where you can write a message of thanks to the social care workforce.</p>
<p>These can be personal messages for a Care Worker who supported a person&#8217;s relative or someone thanking their colleagues. Visit the Care Workers Charity website or use the link below</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zmvH08KXZT"><p><a href="https://www.thecareworkerscharity.org.uk/covid-19-tribute/">Social Care Day of Remembrance and Reflection</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Social Care Day of Remembrance and Reflection&#8221; &#8212; The Care Workers Charity" src="https://www.thecareworkerscharity.org.uk/covid-19-tribute/embed/#?secret=zmvH08KXZT" data-secret="zmvH08KXZT" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The day will be an opportunity for everyone impacted by the work of the social care sector to reflect on the important work done by Care Workers and pay tribute to the people we lost, the people who supported us, and the people who made it through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The Care Workers Charity is also fundraising to invest in a fitting tribute to the important work of the social care sector.</p>
<p>A Just Giving page has been set up for the Social Care Day of Reflection and Remembrance, just go onto the Just Giving website and search for The Care Workers Charity or visit the link below https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/social-care-day-remembrance-and-reflection If you would like to get more involved, there are fundraising packs available on the Care Workers Charity website and Skills for Care also have information available.</p>
<p>Autograph Care will also be creating their own Memorial and Thank You wall on their website.</p>
<p>If you would like to pay tribute to anyone at the Company, please email your message and/or attach your photograph to karen.ragan@autographcare.co.uk</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>A summary of everything we've been up to in July 2021 including BBQs, new furniture, fundraising and birthdays!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A message from the Manager</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Since the last communication I have now been Home Manager for coming up to three months and I honestly don’t know where the time has gone; I guess time the saying is true “time flies when you&#8217;re having fun!”.<br />
We also have a new hairdresser Yvonne who is now in weekly to make theresidents hair look lovely.<br />
I know many of you are on our Monson Retirement Home Facebook page, if I couldplease ask for you all to continue to like our new page ‘Monson Care’. This is where all new photos &amp; news will appear including our recent employees of the month.<br />
We will also use the page to keep everyone updated with new events, suchas our new “Early onset dementia café morning” starting every Thursday from the19th August 2021 supported by Jane Robinson, one of our residents&#8217; daughters. Thank you to Jane <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
As a home, we continue to make the care personal to each resident, whilst we do have generic toiletries available, it would be wonderful if families could continue to please bring intheir loved ones&#8217; favourite items to use.<br />
We believe it is the small things in life that create comfort, especially for the residents.<br />
It really is wonderful to see so many ofyou continuing to visit as things have relaxed more in terms of Covid19 restrictions &#8211; I recently sent out updated guidance on visiting to your personal emails plus the new questionnaire which needs to be completed.<br />
To continue to book please ring us and we will be happy to help.<br />
Stay safe, Joshua</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT&#8217;S BEEN HAPPENING THIS MONTH</strong></p>
