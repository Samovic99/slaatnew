In our home we have some RAF WW2 veterans and some ex-servicemen and women. So we had to visit the Vulcan XH558 in her home hangar. (And later I\u2019ll tell you about our visit to RAF Coningsby Memorial Flight Museum to see the Lancaster)<\/p>\n<p>We certainly seized the opportunity to get \u2018up close and personal\u2019 with the Vulcan VIP Tour. We booked our reservation and on a bright sunny day, packed our lunch and set off to Hangar 3, Robin Hood Airport, Doncaster via a quick stop off for some Sherbet Lemons to eat on route.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 13.8pt 0cm 13.8pt 0cm\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2754 size-large\" title=\"Day Trip on mini bus\" src=\"https:\/\/www.monsonrh.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Trip-on-our-mini-bus-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Day Trip on mini bus\" width=\"980\" height=\"735\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We took two vehicles (shiny new minibus no.2), which obviously led to hijinks on the dual carriageway with our senior citizens insisting the driver overtook the other vehicle so they could gesticulate out of the window as they went past!<\/p>\n<p>The staff at Hangar 3 were amazing. We were welcomed with open arms and a hot cup of tea (not forgetting the biscuits). I don\u2019t know what I was expecting but I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting a plane as large as the Vulcan \u2013 what a bird!<\/p>\n<p>We all sat politely during the presentation. Loved the stories about resurrecting the planes to prepare for bombing the Falkland Islands \u2013 parts were found all over, even in the officer\u2019s mess hall being used as an ashtray!<\/p>\n<p>Then the fun began. Everyone split up and spread out in the hangar. I don\u2019t think the staff was expecting our group of \u201csweet people\u201d from a Retirement Home to get out of their wheelchairs and climb into ejection seats while pretend to steer with their walking sticks.<\/p>\n<p>The sun stayed out while we enjoyed our picnic outside. As I we say here at Monson \u201cAnother fantastic day\u201d!<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 13.8pt 0cm 13.8pt 0cm\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-2753\" title=\"Resident sat in chair at Vulcan\" src=\"https:\/\/www.monsonrh.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IAN-VULCAN-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Resident sat in chair at Vulcan\" width=\"421\" height=\"562\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 13.8pt 0cm 13.8pt 0cm\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-2758\" title=\"Visiting the Vulcan\" src=\"https:\/\/www.monsonrh.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/vulcan-visit-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting the Vulcan\" width=\"423\" height=\"564\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The RAF is predominant with life in Lincolnshire.
