During this period all staff have shown incredible dedication and support to the service. It is estimated that over 1,000 social care staff lost their lives to covid. Others lost their lives for many other reasons, and there was a huge loss of life to Care Home residents.<\/p>\n<p>Organisations across the sector have joined together to create a memorial where people can come together to reflect and remember those that we lost during this time.<\/p>\n<p>A &#8216;Memorial Wall&#8217; and &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page are now available on the Care Workers Charity website. On the site you are able to submit a picture and a message in memory of a friend, colleague or family member who has been lost, which in turn will be featured on the Memorial Wall. In addition to the &#8216;Memorial Wall&#8217; there is a &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page where you can write a message of thanks to the social care workforce.<\/p>\n<p>These can be personal messages for a Care Worker who supported a person&#8217;s relative or someone thanking their colleagues.
