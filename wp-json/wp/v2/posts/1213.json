We\u2019re loving the pub and our smart TV\u2019s work brilliantly for reminiscent viewing of old favourites.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next few weeks we play host to the Bromhead Care Home Service. A highly skilled team providing a Multi-dimensional Care Assessment for each of our residents. Their team consists of a GP, Nurse Practitioner, Physio and Nutritionist whose aim is to identify any medical problems, optimise treatments, improve nutrition and review medications. They will arrange a meeting with residents and their families to discuss their findings and clarify wishes and thoughts for the future in order to create an Advanced Care Plan.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2347 size-full\" title=\"Singing Hymns on New Years\" src=\"https:\/\/www.monsonrh.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Gosple-Service-TEST-1.jpg\" alt=\"Singing Hymns on New Years\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This week we have started working on residents wishes with the aid of with a wonderful lady called Sarah Akerman from Siren FM &#8211; simple wishes, not trips to Florida! Staff have been in discussion with our resident\u2019s for their wishes and planning for the first few is underway:<br \/>\nTo go Swimming: A group have put their names down to visit Yarborough Leisure Centre<br \/>\nSee the Falcon at RAF Waddington<br \/>\nVisit to the seaside for Fish &amp; Chips on the beach and a ride on an open top bus.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2674 size-large\" title=\"Using car game\" src=\"https:\/\/www.monsonrh.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/NEW-PUB-blog-1024x713.jpg\" alt=\"Using car game\" width=\"980\" height=\"682\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2673 size-large\" title=\"Residents on New Years Eve\" src=\"https:\/\/www.monsonrh.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/NEW-PUB-3-blog-1024x648.jpg\" alt=\"Residents on New Years Eve\" width=\"980\" height=\"620\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We start with a visit from \u201cReggie\u201d a cheeky terrier and his owner, who wishes to entertain people in a Care Home. Reggie is quite cute and very well behaved so Charlie and Bertie (our dogs) have happily consented to his visiting!<\/p>\n<p>Our morning exercises are progressing well. There are a few \u201cdie hards\u201d that refuse to participate but fortunately they\u2019re outnumbered by the \u201cJane Fonda\u2019s\u201d. We\u2018re also planning a Masquerade Ball, Valentines Party and visits from our ever popular \u201cSinging Brownies\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Elvis\u2019 Gospel church visit proved so successful that Pastor Vera Lcheke has kindly offered to visit us on a regular basis for singing, dancing and sermons.<\/p>\n<p>As the weather starts to improve we begin works on our new garden with everyone looking forward to planting up the new flowerbeds. I hope they are as enthusiastic with the weeding! Once completed we will have a fantastic space for the summer and a rear entrance from the Car Park.<\/p>\n<p>In March we have Mother\u2019s Day. Another chance for my children to fail miserably with that morning cup of tea in bed! Given our new dining arrangements the staff and I thought it would be nice to offer families the chance to join their mothers for Lunch. Rob the Chef will be slaving over a hot stove (as usual) to dish up a Sunday Lunch with all the trimmings.
