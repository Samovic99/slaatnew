										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A message from the Manager</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Since the last communication I have now been Home Manager for coming up to three months and I honestly don‚Äôt know where the time has gone; I guess time the saying is true ‚Äútime flies when you&#8217;re having fun!‚Äù.<br />
We also have a new hairdresser Yvonne who is now in weekly to make theresidents hair look lovely.<br />
I know many of you are on our Monson Retirement Home Facebook page, if I couldplease ask for you all to continue to like our new page ‚ÄòMonson Care‚Äô. This is where all new photos &amp; news will appear including our recent employees of the month.<br />
We will also use the page to keep everyone updated with new events, suchas our new ‚ÄúEarly onset dementia caf√© morning‚Äù starting every Thursday from the19th August 2021 supported by Jane Robinson, one of our residents&#8217; daughters. Thank you to Jane <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="üòä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
As a home, we continue to make the care personal to each resident, whilst we do have generic toiletries available, it would be wonderful if families could continue to please bring intheir loved ones&#8217; favourite items to use.<br />
We believe it is the small things in life that create comfort, especially for the residents.<br />
It really is wonderful to see so many ofyou continuing to visit as things have relaxed more in terms of Covid19 restrictions &#8211; I recently sent out updated guidance on visiting to your personal emails plus the new questionnaire which needs to be completed.<br />
To continue to book please ring us and we will be happy to help.<br />
Stay safe, Joshua</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT&#8217;S BEEN HAPPENING THIS MONTH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Time for a BBQ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9758 size-medium" src="https://autograph.care/monson/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/July-BBQ-300x254.png" alt="BBQ" width="300" height="254" srcset="https://autograph.care/monson/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/July-BBQ-300x254.png 300w, https://autograph.care/monson/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/July-BBQ.png 442w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We took advantage of the nice weather to get some much needed sun &amp; enjoy a BBQ outside. It was great to see everyone enjoying themselves &amp; eating some delicious food prepared by the chef. Hopefully that&#8217;s not not the last BBQ this summer.</p>

<p>After some extravagant online purchases, everyone was kitted out with Sombrero and Moustaches and a Pi√±ata to be proud of was hung from the ceiling in the bar (it really was an excellent piece of craft and such a shame to shame it to pieces).</p>

<p>We added a couple of inflatable Cacti and along with the Pi√±ata, we constructed a photo frame for the photo along with a huge ‚ÄúPin the Tail on the Donkey‚Äù ‚Äì definitely lots of cheating with that game!</p>
<p>All the tables were lined up in a row, adorned with Mexican flags and our fantastic Chef served up a Mexican supper to be proud of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the summer we thought we would try some new activities ‚Äì we had the transport and the sun so why not go swimming. We has some real enthusiasm for this one!</p>
<p>A quick trip into town for the purchase of suitable swimming attire, a small pack up (swimming always makes you hungry) and off we went to Yarborough Swimming Pool to join the Over 50‚Äôs swim.</p>
<p>Just a small issue when we got in the pool ‚Äì no one said they couldn‚Äôt swim! However, we demonstrated some confident bobbing and walking skills in the pool and enjoyed a good splash. I love my job!</p>

<p>Once again we climbed in to the mini bus, bags of sweets in hand and set off the Washingborough Bowl to test out skills. Some superior techniques were demonstrated while sampling the beverages and cakes.¬† Quite a success actually!</p>

<p>After our successful trip to see the Vulcan we decided to take our Veteran gentleman (and everyone else we could fit in two mini buses) to visit the Battle of Britain Museum in Coningsby.</p>
<p>When we arrived the AEWAC was warming up of the runway with all engines ‚Äì everyone hung of the Mini bus window to get a better look. We saw two Typhoons taking off as well.</p>
<p>Our hero had flown thirty three sorties as a rear gunner in WW2. The staff at Coningsby were amazing. We were given a VIP tour by a fantastic gentleman who told us some wonderful human interest stories about the heroes who flew the planes in WW2. I think everyone shed a tear at some point. Every plane in the Hangar is still airborne.</p>
<p>The Lancaster stood tall and majestic at the end of the Hangar and our own much loved hero stood proudly at the Rear Gunner position for his photo call.</p>
<p>Thank you BBMF for ou¬†r VIP Tour of your amazing establishment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Olive‚Äôs Wish &#8211; a disco</h3>
<p>A tall order when all the nightclubs open at midnight!<br />
Fortunately our new pub provides an excellent party space so decided to have our own disco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After discussion with our residents we decided to spice things up a bit and have a Masquerade Disco! We ordered some masks and everyone set about decorating them with our vast collection of sparkly items in the craft room.</p>

Chef sorted the chocolate supply for the fountain and the goodies to dip in (most of them healthy) Elvis, our resident music guru brought his equipment to DJ. And we threw in a Pi√±ata for good measure.</p>

It is always the old favourites that get everyone up and they certainly did. Lots of dancing, singing and best of all laughter. Obviously, all of the chocolate went and we have many fabulous photos for our album to look back on.</p>

<p>Obviously the day included Red Noses all round and plenty of laughter. We played games all day with a surprising level of competitiveness from ‚ÄúNearest the Pin‚Äù Putting. Blind food tasting was an interesting game. However, my favourite had to be ‚ÄúPlay Your Cards Right‚Äù always loud and always a crowd pleaser!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The RAF is predominant with life in Lincolnshire. In our home we have some RAF WW2 veterans and some ex-servicemen and women. So we had to visit the Vulcan XH558 in her home hangar. (And later I‚Äôll tell you about our visit to RAF Coningsby Memorial Flight Museum to see the Lancaster)</p>
<p>We certainly seized the opportunity to get ‚Äòup close and personal‚Äô with the Vulcan VIP Tour. We booked our reservation and on a bright sunny day, packed our lunch and set off to Hangar 3, Robin Hood Airport, Doncaster via a quick stop off for some Sherbet Lemons to eat on route.</p>
<p style="margin: 13.8pt 0cm 13.8pt 0cm"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2754 size-large" title="Day Trip on mini bus" src="https://www.monsonrh.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Trip-on-our-mini-bus-1024x768.jpg" alt="Day Trip on mini bus" width="980" height="735" /></p>
<p>We took two vehicles (shiny new minibus no.2), which obviously led to hijinks on the dual carriageway with our senior citizens insisting the driver overtook the other vehicle so they could gesticulate out of the window as they went past!</p>
<p>The staff at Hangar 3 were amazing. We were welcomed with open arms and a hot cup of tea (not forgetting the biscuits). I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting but I certainly wasn‚Äôt expecting a plane as large as the Vulcan ‚Äì what a bird!</p>
<p>We all sat politely during the presentation. Loved the stories about resurrecting the planes to prepare for bombing the Falkland Islands ‚Äì parts were found all over, even in the officer‚Äôs mess hall being used as an ashtray!</p>
<p>Then the fun began. Everyone split up and spread out in the hangar. I don‚Äôt think the staff was expecting our group of ‚Äúsweet people‚Äù from a Retirement Home to get out of their wheelchairs and climb into ejection seats while pretend to steer with their walking sticks.</p>
<p>The sun stayed out while we enjoyed our picnic outside. As I we say here at Monson ‚ÄúAnother fantastic day‚Äù!</p>

<p>Well we don‚Äôt agree here at Monson! Every morning everyone is in the lounge dancing and exercising to music. Never a dull exercise class here.</p>
<p>To spice things up and keep them interesting we combine a Salsa vibe curtesy of Alexi our Cuban Care Assistant and thank you to the lovely Chinese lady who teaches us deep breathing and relaxation with slow and gentle movements ‚Äì we love the smiles and judging by the response the daily protein shakes are working.</p>
